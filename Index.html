    <h1><center>Clound Provisioning</center></h1> 
    <li>Description</li>
    <p>Cloud provisioning means getting and handling computer stuff in the cloud to match what apps and services need. It's like ordering virtual servers, storage space, and internet connections when you need them. You can usually do this by yourself or set up automated systems to do it for you.</p>
    <li>Features</li>
    <p>Cloud provisioning provides visibility and control over resource usage and costs. Users can monitor resource utilization, set budget thresholds, and implement cost-saving measures such as automated shutdowns during off-peak hours.</p>
    <li>5 Types</li>
    <p>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) Provisioning</p>
    <p>Platform as a Service (PaaS) Provisioning</p>
    <p>Software as a Service (SaaS) Provisioning</p>
    <p>Container as a Service (CaaS) Provisioning</p>
    <p>Function as a Service (FaaS) Provisioning</p>
    <li>3 Benefits</li>
